<p>We'll delve into the world of Android Augmented Reality in this article. We'll use ARCore, Google's framework for creating augmented reality experiences. We'll look at how ARCore is transforming AR app creation by abstracting complex matrix and vector math and providing us with beautiful AR APIs.<br>According to Wikipedia, "augmented reality" is a technology that "superimposes a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, producing a composite view."In essence, augmented reality (AR) is a technology that allows us to project computer-generated 3D object models into the real world and make them interact with their environments as if they were physically present.</p>

<p>Augmented reality (AR) serves as a bridge between humans and computers, allowing businesses to market their products more effectively. It's no surprise, then, that technology is growing in popularity every day.<br>AR, in particular, does not construct an artificial world; rather, it interacts with the current environment and adds functionality to it. AR's use of displaying digital 3D models in the real world through a mobile camera is one example.<br>Developing AR applications a few years ago meant learning OpenGL and complex vector math. In order to make AR development easier for developers, Google launched ARCore along with Sceneform SDK (for Android) in 2018.</p>
